# Primarily for jobs like IngestJob to revivify an equivalent FileActor to one that existed on
# the caller's side of an asynchronous Job invocation.  This involves providing slots
# for the metadata that might travel w/ the actor's various supported types of @file.
# For example, we cannot just do:
#
#   SomeJob.perform_later(arg1, arg2, File.new('/path/to/file'))
#
# Because we'll get:
#
#   ActiveJob::SerializationError: Unsupported argument type: File
#
# This also applies to Hydra::Derivatives::IoDecorator, Tempfile, etc., pretty much any IO.
#
# @note Along with user and file_set_id, path or uploaded_file are required.
#  If both are provided: path is used preferentially for access IF it exists;
#  however, the uploaded_file is used preferentially for default original_name and mime_type,
#  because it already has that information.
